## 🚀 Deploying to Google Cloud Run

To deploy this backend on Google Cloud Run, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure the server listens on the correct port**  
   Cloud Run requires your app to listen on the port provided by the `PORT` environment variable (default is 8080). This is already handled in `server.js`:
   ```js
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || config.server.port || 8080;
   ```
2. **Build and push the Docker image**
   ```sh
   gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/simple-slip-backend
   ```
3. **Deploy to Cloud Run**
   ```sh
   gcloud run deploy simple-slip-backend \
     --image gcr.io/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/simple-slip-backend \
     --platform managed \
     --region <YOUR_REGION> \
     --allow-unauthenticated
   ```
   - Replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with your Google Cloud project ID.
   - Replace `<YOUR_REGION>` with your preferred region (e.g., `asia-south1`).

4. **Access your deployed service**
   - After deployment, Cloud Run will provide a public URL for your backend.

### Notes
- Make sure you have the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and authenticated.
- If you use a `.env` file or other secrets, configure them using Cloud Run environment variables or Secret Manager.
- For more details, see the [Cloud Run documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying).

## 💾 Data Import Script

The project includes a utility script for bulk importing products and their initial prices from a CSV file into the Supabase database.

- **Location**: `scripts/importProducts.js`
- **Input CSV File**: Expects a CSV file at `data/products_with_prices.csv` (configurable in the script).

### Purpose

This script is designed to populate the `products` and `price_board` tables. It's particularly useful for initial data setup or when migrating from another system.

### Key Features & Behavior

- Reads product data (name, brand, category, sale price) from the specified CSV file.
- Infers a `default_unit` for each product based on its title and category (e.g., 'kg', 'g', 'pc').
- Processes products in batches to manage load on the Supabase API and database.
- Performs a batch check for existing products (based on name, unit, and brand) before attempting to insert, to minimize duplicates.
- Inserts new products into the `products` table.
- Inserts the corresponding sale price for each new product into the `price_board` table with the current date as the `effective_date`.
- Provides a console summary of the import process, including total rows read, new products added, and new price entries added.

### How to Run

Navigate to the project's root directory and execute:

```bash
node scripts/importProducts.js
```

### Important Considerations

- **Configuration**: The path to the input CSV file (`CSV_FILE_PATH`), batch size (`BATCH_SIZE`), and delay between batches (`DELAY_BETWEEN_BATCHES_MS`) are configurable at the top of the `importProducts.js` script.
- **Data Integrity & Re-runs**: 
    - If you need to re-run the import after a partial success or to refresh all data, it's highly recommended to first clear the existing data from the target tables to avoid potential duplicate entries or inconsistencies. You can do this using the following SQL commands in your Supabase SQL editor:
      ```sql
      TRUNCATE TABLE products RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
      TRUNCATE TABLE price_board RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
      ```
    - **Duplicate Check Filter Note**: The current duplicate check mechanism uses `encodeURIComponent` for product names, units, and brands. While this handles many special characters, characters like parentheses `()` or commas `,` within these fields might not be perfectly escaped for the Supabase filter string, potentially leading to a `PGRST100` parsing error for that batch's check. If this occurs, the script currently proceeds by assuming products in that specific batch are new. For more robust duplicate prevention in such cases, the filter construction in `processBatch` within `importProducts.js` can be enhanced by ensuring values are double-quoted (e.g., `name.eq."${encodedValue}"`). This fix was discussed but deferred for now.
- **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error logging. If issues occur, check the console output for details.

### Key Files Explained

#### Configuration

- **config/index.js**: Centralizes all application configuration. It loads environment variables and provides validation for required values. All environment variables should be accessed through this module rather than directly from process.env.

#### Controllers

Controllers handle the business logic for each feature area:

- **authController.js**: Handles user registration, login, and token generation
- **slipsController.js**: Manages creating, retrieving, and formatting sales slips
- **pricesController.js**: Handles product catalog and price management
- **voiceController.js**: Processes voice input (currently mock implementation)
- **whatsappController.js**: Handles WhatsApp messaging (currently mock implementation)

#### Routes

Routes define the API endpoints and connect them to the appropriate controller functions:

- **auth.js**: Authentication endpoints (/api/auth/*)
- **slips.js**: Sales slip endpoints (/api/slips/*)
- **prices.js**: Product and price endpoints (/api/prices/*)
- **voice.js**: Voice processing endpoints (/api/voice/*)
- **whatsapp.js**: WhatsApp integration endpoints (/api/whatsapp/*)

#### Middleware

- **auth.js**: Validates JWT tokens and protects routes from unauthorized access

#### Utilities

- **errorHandler.js**: Provides consistent error handling throughout the application
  - `catchAsync`: Wraps async controller functions to avoid try/catch boilerplate
  - `AppError`: Creates standardized API errors with status codes
  - `globalErrorHandler`: Express middleware for formatting error responses
  
- **validator.js**: Validates request data
  - `validateBody`: Ensures required fields are in the request body
  - `validateId`: Validates ID parameters in routes
  - `validateQuery`: Ensures required query parameters are present

#### Database

- **supabase.js**: Initializes and exports the Supabase client for database operations

#### Services

- **pdfService.js**: Generates PDF receipts for slips

## Design Patterns Used

1. **MVC Architecture**: The codebase follows a Model-View-Controller pattern
   - Models: Supabase tables
   - Views: JSON responses and PDF generation
   - Controllers: Business logic in controller files

2. **Middleware Pattern**: Authentication and validation as Express middleware

3. **Factory Pattern**: Error handling utilities create standardized errors

4. **Repository Pattern**: Database operations are centralized in controller functions

5. **Configuration Management**: Centralized config with validation

## 📝 Example Requests

### Create a Slip

```javascript
// POST /api/slips
{
  "customerName": "राज कुमार",
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": 1,
      "qty": 2,
      "unit": "kg",
      "rate": 40
    },
    {
      "product_id": 2,
      "qty": 1,
      "unit": "kg", 
      "rate": 120
    }
  ],
  "discount": 10,
  "gstRequired": false
}
```

### Login

```javascript
// POST /api/auth/login
{
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
```

### Process Voice Input

```javascript
// POST /api/voice/process
{
  "audioData": "base64-encoded-audio-data",
  "language": "hi",
  "shopId": 1
}
```

## Error Handling

The application uses a consistent error handling approach:

1. **Operational Errors**: Predictable errors like invalid input, missing records
   - These return specific error messages to the client
   - Example: 404 Not Found when a slip doesn't exist

2. **Programming Errors**: Unexpected errors like database connection issues
   - These return generic messages in production but detailed errors in development
   - All errors are logged for debugging

3. **Error Format**: All errors follow this format:
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "status": "error",
     "message": "Error description"
   }
   ```

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Twilio WhatsApp integration
- [ ] Offline sync capabilities

## Development Notes

### Adding New Features

To add a new feature to the application:

1. Create a controller in `/controllers` with the business logic
2. Create routes in `/routes` that use the controller functions
3. Add the routes to `server.js`
4. Update tests if necessary

### Understanding the Authentication Flow

1. User provides credentials (phone/password)
2. Server validates credentials against Supabase
3. JWT token is generated with user details
4. Token is returned to client
5. Client includes token in Authorization header for subsequent requests
6. `auth.js` middleware validates token for protected routes
